# Additional Resources

There are many additional resources to help you find our more about OpenCL and to use it to speed up *your* applications on multiple platforms.

The remaining sections of this User Guide will show you how to install the Khronos OpenCL SDK on your machine and start programming using the provided samples as a starting point.

The definitive versions of all OpenCL core specifications and extensions are on the [OpenCL Registry](https://www.khronos.org/registry/OpenCL/).

Khronos-supplied OpenCL resources and other key tools are curated by the OpenCL Working Group on the [OpenCL Resource Guide](https://www.khronos.org/opencl/resources).

The [OpenCL Community Resources Page](https://www.khronos.org/opencl/community-resources/) is an extensive, crowd-sourced listing of OpenCL open source implementations, development tools, language bindings, libraries and frameworks, educational materials, and OpenCL applications. Anyone in the OpenCL Community is encouraged to submit information about your own OpenCL resources, tools, and projects with a pull request to the GitHub site.

You can interact directly with the OpenCL Working Group on the [Khronos OpenCL Forum](https://community.khronos.org/c/opencl/14) or the [OpenCL channel of the Khronos Developer Slack](https://app.slack.com/client/TDMDFS87M/CDSBQPH2Q).
